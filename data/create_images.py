# z_s circle
# z_c square 
# use alpha_c and alpha_s to control size/pixel footprint for train & val. 
# test is kept as the baseline footprint/base z values. 
# The baseline footprint is 400px
# color = respective feature values 
# manipulate size of square and circle. 

# random position of circle and square, no overlap
# output image size is 224x224
