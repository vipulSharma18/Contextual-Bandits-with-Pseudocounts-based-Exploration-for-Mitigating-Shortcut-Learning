# Exploration-For-Shortcut-Learning
Features used by ANNs often differ from humans, they prefer more available features (pixel footprint) even if they are less or similarly predictive as the core ones. The project uses exploration &amp; bandits to guide a supervised learning algo to attend to the core features instead of the spurious ones.


## Notes: 
1. Bias is averaged across 5 runs of the models (so total 10 runs since model and optimal classifier)
