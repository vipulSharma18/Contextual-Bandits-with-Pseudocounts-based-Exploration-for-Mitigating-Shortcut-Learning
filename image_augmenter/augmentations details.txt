Patch-based augmentation (torchvision): 
affine transform
rotation
random color jittering, 
random horizontal flip, and 

patches: learn patch to state dictionary mapping. 
bandits get multiple states as input. 
with each image, the order of the states is random and hence,
the reward is random to pick or not pick a state.

Class-wise exploration counts (Spurious for one, core for another)
